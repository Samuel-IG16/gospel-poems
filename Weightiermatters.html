        <div class="poem-text">It concerns the greatest treasure
Not to be bargained for moments pleasure
Which in tripartite man is not measured?
You have a soul to save
There is a hell to escape
A terrible place of pain.
There is a heaven to gain
Where you do not need money
Now is the good time to start the journey
To a prepared place for prepared people
Though, trouble and in life disabled
The shore of paradise conveys security
Salvation and righteousness attributes of spiritual maturity,
Are stepping stones to God.
There is a way, broad and smooth
The other, narrow and straight
One leads to life and glory
The other to death and gloom
Brace not yourself to stand the blows of divine truth
It may smart and sting, but it heals and recovers
Don't take the broad way that seems right,
For sin has blinded your eyes, warp your judgment
It is a religious road that leads to hell
Take the Calvary road that leads to life
It ostratizes and buries you with worthy few
There are many ways to hell, but one way to God
There are many books of men but only one word of God
Man has many remedies for sin, God has one the blood of Jesus
Religious works abound, only one work saves
Christ is the way and not a plan or creed
People may embrace his person and deeds
Doctrines makes one to be as dead as a door post
But practice of the gospel
Is like a living fish fearing neither tide nor current
In living a life devoid of sin, in a world of sin
Like a saltless fish, in a salty sea.</div>

        <div class="poem-text">Formed and fashioned by satan
It has many a man and woman
Entangled under his throes
Hear now or all you lads
That is feeling so bad
It is a cancer of the soul
A nagging thorn in the flesh
And nibbling constant cares
The right path is narrow and even
Its path is broad of evil
Arthful in a cunny way
Subtle in a rational way
Many a life are bristled with woes
Consequence on sinful nature
Which is attended with ineveitable hour
The toll that sins takes in man's life
Surpasses every twinkling of eyes
Brainwashingly, to you it says.
Just eat and drinkn and merry be
Forget tomorrow life is carefree
Stay up late in revel tonight
And make yourself to girls a sight
Lo! I say, you will realize with a start
Even as your body and soul are apart
And being justly sentenced to hell
Choose now the good way known
And it will take you to heaven your home
Salvation is a treasure never let it go
Sin is no pleasure
Though satan tells you so
Though many had tried it
Lo! Don't try its bitter taste
For too late they find it living their life a waste
Sin in revel has many a purse drained
Having clouded man's thinking.
Behold much taint their breath
Insanely with wages of sin-death
Satan makes sin the bait of his trap
Throwing it to the mind, a swift dart
Blend attractive to catch the eyes
Caught are slaves they know not why
To be saved from it you hear them cry
Now come to Christ and get excused
For having had your life abused</div>

With equitable triune nature
Made in the image of God
But spoilt by the treachery of evil
Man, Whom God breath the breath of life
But satan the breath of hell.
The spiritual reality in him
Is poised between two worlds
The daughter of man beguile by mortal foe
Roves the street to fill their purse
And are condemn to groan.
Come back to Him whose love is unfathomable
And be vouch safe out of His mercy
Before it comes, the inevitable hour
His blood bought love liberate the filthy.
Like king Solomon I assert mine
Go to the ants thou o man
Consider it's ways and be thou wise
In this will you overcome the mortal foe
Who has got many under his throes</div>

        <div class="poem-text">Born sinner by nature and by practice
Encumbered and clothed in its vice
We are living in trouble times
Life is a puzzle to come by
The pieces just fall in places
Having to trade our soul for moment riches
We have found ourselves in spiritual
Kindergarten where bewild infants
Are spelling God with the wrong blocks
Lo! We can't make head or tail of life
Is there light in his shroulded earth
Of uncertainty chaos and fertility
We have fallen to God penal offence
By sin the root cause of our fraity
Ah we are undone to whom shall we have recourse
Glory! The light of the lord is dawn on us
Jesus is the way the truth
All our sins to him we spread to get absolution by his blood shed
Fret not my soul
So long God with us
The storm shall rage
And never can we be swayed
In Christ we are too enthusiastic
To be chilled and daunted by setback
Come what may in this transistory word
We shall stand through thick and thin in Christ
From the stormy blast and raging tempest,
He guides us through the maze of life
Victoriously against the mortal foes
Put this in mind also</div>

Persecution vis-à-vis temptation
Is the Christians spiritual examination?
And victoriously their spiritual promotion
Every now and then it comes to us a test of faith
For lo! It is half the battle to overcome in life
With surprise, siege, strategy and subtility
The antics and tactics of satan
But I know that God is with me
The storm of life shall spent itself
And I will remain anchored in Christ
So long as my vision of him is not chilled and daunted
Come what may in this transistory world
Over the insidious attacks of satan
I shall stand through thick and thin in Christ</div>

        <div class="poem-text">This is the prophecy to those to be born
This is the biography of those who has been born
This is a divine decree: "…men once to die…"
This bible decree is confirmed by bible chronology
"…and he died." Reccorded monotonously and morbidly.
Methuselah's epitaph as recorded in the bible
Reads the same as his shorter lived brethren-"and he died"
All of adams race died
They died of an age in all ages
Death is the greatest day to Christians
And a time of eternal torment for sinners
You may be avowed atheist
A blantant blasphemer
A calloused and cocky Christ rejector
A deceived deluded denier of the "the victor"
After death you will go to hell, being rejected
Are you looking where you are going?
Are you going where you are looking?
Are you looking and going to heaven?
The yonder celestial haven!
Know that where you are looking!
Determines where you are going!</div>

        <div class="poem-text">It is going along nibbling on constant cares
The lfe is irritating more often than pleasing
Timorous more often often than calm
It is being disturb, pertube and frankly frustrated
The sinner devoid of their life vaguest impression
Swim and wallow in a sea of sin
This they do without the faintest idea
Sinners pride on vague control of their life
But you can bet this
They will reap their wages – death
As satan the goblin will halt their breath
Sin bodg's man down in a morals of thraldom
The sinners problem boils down to sin
And there are several spot of human nature
Iniquity of the heart, a sin of bastard variety
Brings a life of muddling living.
Transgressor the law breaker
Abomination a taboo commited
Satan makes offers purporting sin's pleasure
The nostrums and quackery's of evil measure
That stinks and swamps the sinners
Living in sin is the bread and butter of satan
Serving to cement the chronicity of hell-to-earth
No limit to the variety and nuisance of it's art
It wipes the sinner out of house and savings
With business venture going to the wall
Living in sin makes satan camp on your trail
Bringing confounded nuisance to you in trivail
As you surmise its tactic pians
In your life might and main
Living in sin is a life
Tensed, discouraged forlorn and futile
It's laudable benefit is artificial jolly
Dithered and devoid of anything holy
Sin nips life in the bud before it blooms
Bringing a life devoid of sparkle and luster
Give your life to Christ and be free from the mortal foes
Let this in mind also</div>

It is different from shekar' – strong drinks
This has been a bone of contention
A hive and pedestal for elevated discourse
Lo! For ages liquor is the poison taken by men
That steal away their brains and brawns
They drink themselves tipsy and run amok
An unmitigated evil difficult to do away.
Drunkenness clouds the intellect and fogs the brain
Making them worst than useless drags in society
Listen friends! "it is more destructive than wars
It is the devil in solution
Ah! It is distilled damination
Many a man has err due to false vision
Its luck is proverbial for it fickleness
A cancer also in human society
On the quick sand of morbid superiority
It anchors the inebriates
Alas eating out their vitals
The most tacit method of assassination
Ever evented by any age or nation
It has killed lots than all wars of nations
It is the raging mocker that deceives
Those that imbibe it invite and welcome tragedy
For it brings sin and debauchery
Making drunkards acquiesce to vices tacitly
For it is their shortlived happiness.
Come to Christ, who gives pepetual happiness
And above all eternal life hereafter.</div>

Obviously in a pensive mien
It came unfoldingly – man!
God has made you king of circumstances and nature
Had the mortal foe given you its nature
What have you in heart and mind?
To do God's will is all you mind
What in the heart had taken root?
Whither thou goest the good or bad route?
A sinner in sin surely needs the savior
Who can save from sin grievous sour
Christ who from above came the savior
Bounds indissoluble are by his sundered
Though fortune is inconstant and tempers are soured
No tyranny of circumstance or mortal foe
Can dissuade you to sin throes
Put it in mind also
In Jesus's love we can make heaven
Even at the ineveitable hour
As our wane life wan off
To meet him across the azure.</div>

        <div class="poem-text">Philosophers may prate there is no hell
'Foolosophy' has warped their knowledge well
This they uphold to make a name
But the rich man says '…i am tormented in this flame'.
The possibility and credibility
Could be prove by scientific study
By laws of logic , and by rules of reason
The rich man in hell as Bible says is for all a lesson
A man in eternity a man with a tale to tell
At this moment he is in pain in hell
Not "just a grave" as the Jehovah's witnesses alibi
Not "annihilation of souls" as the 7th day Adventist's lullaby
Hell is a real, literal and actual place
Listen there is a Heaven to win and a Hell to shun
For in hell the torture is more than being put inside the sun
A place of unparalleled suffering and torment
As the rich man still testify to this moment
A place of an unforgettable past
In which you listen to the play back of your own memory
A place of unanswered prayers, unsatisfied desires
The Belshazzars will not have their wine
The Ahabs will not have their Naboths vineyards
The Felix will not have their Drusillas
The Herods will not have their sensuous dances
The Judas will not have their cancered gold
They cry in bitter,blitthing voices
One song , one note ,one cadence, one refrain
Forever, forever forever forever
With their burning faces, glazed eyes and tortured hands
Despair, despondency, disaster, death, yea doom
I have penned this pungent poem
To you and to them.</div>

Then he drank heavily and habitually
First he drank delicately
Then drank daringly
First he drank proudly
Then he drank ploddingly
First he was care free about it but soon he was crushed by it
A dishelled, depraved derelict drunkard.
Alcohol mightily merciless and murderous
Bringing broken families and abused children
With a condemning conscience and dissipating dearth.
A lamentable alcoholic life and sin sated soul
Makes you a hardened sinner, God says
In the bible …all have sinned.
Are you a drunkard lying in your vomit
And in your stupor in the gutter
An alcoholic who shuffles up the street
Asking for death dealing alcohol, making the mind to stray
With pernicious practice of lust and licentiousness
The word of God brings conviction
That JESUS died for your salvation
From sin sated sin shackled and sin sickened soul
But heard in every wail of woe
And behind every sin and sorrow
The gun, the knife, the deadly deed,
The satanic scheme and unkind cutting words
And the whole world godless greed
Is what the alcoholic breed.
Though their sin is more than
A woeful word, a damnable force
Through Jesus, alcohol is a conquerable foe</div>
