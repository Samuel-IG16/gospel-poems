        <div class="poem-text">There was a man - 'Valentine Burke',
An old time buglar
With Kilt and guns
Always ready to hit and run.
The same, in prison, read in a paper
"How the jailer of philipi got caught"
It tells of the amazing work
of Christ in Paul and Silas
That were jailed for good works
As they prayed and sang
As the book of truth records
The prison were shakened, the door opened
by a great earthquake from the Lord God
The jailer, thinking, all had escaped
Was about to end his life and end it all
Paul said with a voice aloud
"Do thyself no harm: Here are we all"
The jailer amazed, desired the greatest wish
"What must I do to be saved"
Paul with the annointing of the Holy Ghost said
"Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ
And thou and thine house shall be saved"
At this, Valentine gave himself to Christ
Like the jailer of phillipi
Like Valentine Burke, I beseech you come to Christ
He will develop your personality
Improve your proficiency
Realise your prospect
And increase your prosperity
And above all, He will give you eternal life
For a man can make or mar his life.</div>

        </figure>
        <div class="poem-text">Our sins deserve eternal doom
But christ for us went to the cross
To take on himself our fate and gloom
Crucified, no death was so thorough
No shame was so complete.
To set us free from death, He took this way so rough
Stripes and bruises was his body replete
With the flogging and scourging post
This he did for us with love ultmost.
For our iniquity he was bruised and chastised
The body became rigid of knotted muscles
No gentle massaging hand to see.
Colour drained from his lovely cheeks,
That were drawn tight to the teeth
With cummulative pain no moment of respite
Sweat burst from the brow and stung the eyes.
The sun shone directly on His beautiful eyes
Oh! Jesus my hope; for me offered up.
Instead of water they gave him vinegar
The macabre scene was played out
He humbled Himself, obedient unto death;
Unto God the father, he commended His spirit
The deed was done;
Which shook the earth and veiled the sun.
Hallelujah! Up from the grave He arose to reign
His death was the end of a foul deed
Schemed for; cunningly contrived
And above all fiendishly achieved.
It is the crown of His sublime deed
Planned in Heaven, wrought on earth;
And gloriously consummated on cross
A glance at the cross saves, the gaze of it sanctifies
For now, I feel my Lord's atoning blood
Close to my soul applied
Me, you He loved - the Son of God
His resurrection provides us with power
For me, for you He lives to pardon.</div>

        </figure>
        <div class="poem-text">Humility - the perfection of man's nature
Making God to be all
The sense of man's nothingness
Which comes as seeing God to be all.
Rooted in the spirit of lowliness
Christ is humilty personified
The root from which God's grace grow
The only soil in which His grace root
And the tree can't do without the root,
Is your root pride or humility?
Wither do you choose?
The ball is in your court
Humility is the glory of God's creation
The first duty, and highest virtue of creatures.
A nobility deeper than contrition
Primal to the meek and lowly lamb of God
Lack of it is in the root of sin and evil.
Old serpent fell from it's glorious pinnacle
Breathing the poison of pride to heart of man,
Who hitherto fell from his high position.
Pride - the gate, births and curses of hell.
But the loop-hole is the restoration of humanity
Which the meek and lowly lamb did.
His humilty is the salvation
Expelling all malcontent in saved souls,
Lock, stock and barreled against mortal foes;
Let this in mind, also.</div>

        <div class="poem-text">All stars in there full brilliances
And the moon in its radiance
The night was calm, cool and conducive
Suddenly; momentarily the silence was broken
Not with the alarm of war or shout of applause;
But God's angel praising God, the highest
Who to them broke the good tidings;
"For unto you is born ...Christ the Lord"
It was a remarkable day in annals of human history
As the shephard hastened to bade the saviour welcome
Oh you sinful and sleepy prodigal'
In the silence of your night hear
The voice of your conscience and
Decide, "I will arise and go to my saviour"
That same night the three magicians,
Watching on top their tower,
The star of God's son held them in consternation
Not waiting for the day to dawn
They went to worship he who is born king of kings
Angels bestowed their ministry in that silent night
To who was born of Holy Ghost begotten of God.
The night was the expression of God's love
The hallmark for his concern for souls.
It made all creatures of the earth at peace with joy
The night that toll the knell of sin and death,
Silently liberating man from throes and thralldom</div>

Came into this world, in form of virgin birth
Lived a virtuous life, died a vicarious death
And on the third day had a victorious resurrection
All to save from hell, man's soul.
The testimonies of His coming
Are complete, consistent and conclusive
His words are axioms, alive with authority
He spoke in argument, motive an command
Do you understand His arguments?
Do you appreciate His motives?
Do you obey His commands?
Adam brought death, He brings life
His love took the place of law and brought joy
Gracious with tact to worst sinnners
He came as an offering and sacrifice for our sins
His death was vicious, official and certified
His resurrection is "the best proven fact of history"
To liberate us from sin and purchase our pardon
By all who appreciate his redemptive work
His life is the living epistle to be learned and lived
He came to march man's feet and soul, God-ward
To this paramount purpose
He was whole time, whole man and whole heart
In Him is the Way back to God
The TRUTH for every bend and road fork
The LIFE all along to heaven our home
He is the opened door of mercy for the age
And a door of hope for the young
He is the expression of God's love
The hallmark of his concern for souls
Call Him into your life
And he shall toll the knell of sin and death
In your life and above all
Make your life soberly, righteously and Godly
And eternal life is yours, hereafter.</div>

To make turbulent men, salvation prone
So that all and sundry can be His own
He was born contrary to the law of life;
His love brought Him, a virgin birth for a virteous life
The atmosphere damped with sin
Could not wet or cling to His skin
He was clothed with the garment of righteousness
In a stable on a manger as His cradle.
A baby calm, cheerful, cool, and collected
Content and celebrated
For His remarkable disposition
Born to stand forth upon the highest pinnacle of heavenly glory
His entrance to the stage of the world was pious and Goldly
Though He encountered many a cross and difficulty
He was all spotless, radiating God's beauty;
He was amiable, appproachable and accessible
For His blessings which He gave the three magicians and shepherds
The shepherd came to bade Him welcome,
To us all for righteous life He beckons
To see the saviour, the three magicians set on their Way
Christ moon arose to lighten their path way;
And His bright star directed from the east, their Way
The bethlehem baby, is the way and, not a plan or creed,
His birth is unique, His purpose is unique
The baby unlimited in power, unparalleled in glory
Simple as breathing, inevitable as sun rise
In infancy He startled king Herod who could not kill Him
Man is drugged by sin and satan
His birth was the beginning of our liberation
The prophecies and testimonies of His birth,
Are complete, consistent and conclusive</div>

Like astronauts journey to space

"For the lord Himself shall descend..."
What sober words of inspired reality
The saved 'swallows' are soon gone
The winter of this world will come
"...Caught up together with them in the clouds"
What blessed comfort! sweet and precious hope
Last book last chapter
Penultimate verse and least prayer
Testify for His speedy return
No good works can jet-propel your soul
For it is impossible for wood to be magneted
False teachers deny it
Religious people delay it
Born again Christains desire it

Awaited by the founder high priest
No breaking hearts for cheek glow ashen
No heavy mind for eye glaze
No watching the undertaker as he screws
Down the coffin lid on the belove
Bless me! no black dress and veils
No funerals no dirge no grave
No standing by a yawning grave
Watching a coffin lowered into it
No listening to the cold clods
Falling remorselessly onto it
The journey to this celestial city
Starts now with breath on and soul propensity
Agog, aware of where to rest
On wither home, Heaven or Hell?
Behold at anytime of the year
Over and past is satan's gloomy reign
The happy time of hallelujah songs is near
When we are claded with christ glorious might
When times ceases, when earth and sky
Rings in memory lane of days gone by
We rejoice together still from age to age
Acclaiming our heavenly sacred heritage
Eternally established above is christ throne
He is the builder and the architect alone
And the angels and saints shall intone
Christ owns praises and blessings only.</div>

        <div class="poem-text">Unique in every sense of the term
He was born contrary to the law of life
His death is contrary to the law of death
He lived in poverty
Poorer than a church rat
He posses neither wealth
Nor any social prestige
But was content and celebrated
For his remarkable disposition
"In infancy He startled a king"
In childhood he puzled doctors
In manhood he ruled the course of nature
He walked upon the waves as pavements
And hushed the sea to sleep
He had no bakery or fisheries
But he spread a table for five thousand
And have bread and fish to spare
He healed the multitude without medicine
And made no charge for his service
He wrote no books but books are written of him
He wrote no songs but songs are written of him
He never practiced psychiatry
Yet he has healed more broken hearts
When he died few men put on sack cloths
But a black crepe was hung over the sun
Thou men trembled not for their sins
The earth beneath them shook under the load
And all nature honoured Him
Corruption could not get hold of His body
The soil reddened with His blood
Could not claim His dust
Once each week the wheels of commerce
Cease their turning and multitude
Wend their way to worship.
Assemblies to pay homage to Him
Though time has fleeted the conscience
Of His crucifixion
Yet He still lives
Herod couldn't destroy Him, grave couldn't hold Him
Now He stands forth upon the highest
Pinnacle of heavenly glory
Proclaimed of God
Acknowledged by angels
Adored by saints and feared by devils
Give your life to this unique Christ
Who has crossed the world's horizon?
And you can while blissfully the rest
of your days.</div>

        <div class="poem-text">Truth is not an esoteric philosophy
Meant for the stoic philosophers
In as much as He is invisible
The lips of the truthful shall be establish
He proves to the hilt and brings to book
All evil deeds and motives
With His potent and vocal force
Truth is the rock of ages
He stands without a tremble
While raging waves pounds on,
Only to be smashed to pieces
He laugh at all attempt to discredit Him
To those that are not kindly disposed to Him
He lies both in words and relationship
He is an impenetrable citadel to His adherent
The bible is an epitome of Him
Don't doubt, quibble or deny Him
For the aftermath is very perilous
Lie is devil-born and sin-coddled
So dump it all at His throne of grace
For He is so over reign
He acts and that settled it
He speaks and that is the final
He is timeless forever true!
He may be castigated, maybe conceited
May be condemned, He is always true
The mighty matchless message
Meant for this day and age
With Him heaven as your hope
Shall become heaven home.</div>

        </figure>
        <div class="poem-text">Gentled, riding on a donkey
His way to glory was met with praise
Not with applause of parade or support of fame
He rode on, the king of kings
Without jeweled crown
Tranquilly and modestly on a tiny creature
As the embodiment of humility, His nature
Slowly He move for the feeble and little to keep pace
Gentle He is to all kind of race
His voice open, receive and welcoming
All and sundry with love unrejecting
Heart broken guilt
Find it natural to come to Him
Walking with Him riding to glory
They come confessing, He forgives
They come weeping He consoles
And becomes near Him as His own
He rode on, heading not for coronation
But for the green hill of gethsemane
To Golgotha and the cross mainly
The children with joyous mood cheers
As their elders panicking heart fear
At Golgotha spectators becomes serious seeker
As His life seeds new life to all
His way to glory was through death
As seeds to ground and become new life
Bringing forth many of it kind as fruit
So all that comes to Him are His fruit
Seeing that by law sin end with death
His, was not martyrdom, but an act of atonement
Which bring eternal life to His fruits.</div>
