        <div class="poem-text">The wind is still blowing again
Which the early penticostal gained
Powerful current in precedented ways
Through the strings of mortal souls
Beaming in Christ a life gay
In all clime and nation hill and dale
The bastion of the devil
Have been defeated from evil
Behold the power has come
To, the rich and peasant He becomes
Have the salvation of your priceless soul
Has He been breathed into you?
To make you wrestle for men's soul
Lifting many a man from fiery abyss
Whose ways and manner of life is amiss
Who by substility satan's swade
But sacrificial love have Him stayed
He is that make God's wrath stay
If He be taken, even now, today
Then shall hell be let loose
A time of apostacy and sin it may
And acts of war let loose
He, is, who sparks the fire of love
And make man, give His life for the lord
Man's bone were aforetime dry
But His breath makes them live
At this age of the last days
Behold, the spirit of truth is come
The third of the triune now beckons
Opening for us the treasures of God's love
Bequeathing to His church spiritual gifts
Manifesting in vigorous congregational life
Setting man into a living torch
The power has come the kingdom is dawn
In a breath taking pageant of conquest
Injecting streams of life to His born church
Which flows as rivers of living water
Oh have you tasted the living water?
And His word which is living and lucid
And His gift which is a boom and blessing
His works are gleaming vanguard of God's grace
Like cooling drops of water on fevered face.</div>

        <div class="poem-text">The psalmist offered praises to His glory
Because He died that we might be Holy
All living things gesticulate to His honour
For he had, to nurture bestowed pleasure
Pouring down His blessings-a great boom
For all unsaved and saved from sin and future doom
Salvation is His greatest work for us
That is why unto Him we sing a chorus
with all the trumpets, flutes and fife
In every circumstances of life
Is life today a Psalm of praise?
Despite our ingratitude and His ever abundant grace?
Some, like nine lepers of old by Him cleansed
Had forgotten Him and rejected being a saint
Recieve Jesus and praise Him in your body and soul
Your gratitude to Him through thick and thin makes you His own.
The skeptic say this we do to avoid reality
But it is the way of confronting reality
It is giving credit to whom credit is due
For this cause His blessings comes as the dew
What shall I give for His care and love
It is praise and many more
The continual offering of it requires stamina
Our reciprocity, it's God's own manna
He takes away depression and makes us normal.</div>

Gives life to mortal face
Life wisdom and joy
All along the time of mortal days
God the father, the supra power
God the son, the good shepherd
God the Holy Spirit, the conforter
God is waiting to welcome sinners
Jesus Christ is seeking and saving
The Holy Spirit is convincing and restoring
The word of God makes me sure
The blood of Christ makes me safe
The Holy Spirit makes me sound
In the will of God my holiness is purposed
At the cross of Christ it was made posssible
By the Holy Spirit it is made feasible
In God's beehive there are no drones
In Christ's own army no retirement
And the Holy Spirit turns potentiality to actuality
God works immutably and inexorably by law
Jesus Christ works by unfanthomable love
The Holy Spirit works by divine Grace
Unto this three in one shall my service
Be whole time, whole-man and whole-heart
And when the trumpets sound for rapture
Setting free man from mortal foes
The faithful flock shall they rapture
To the new Jerusalem, souls celestial shore
Let this in mind also.</div>

        </figure>
        <div class="poem-text">It is in itself a science,
To be learned and lived.
The issue of a tranquil mind,
Of untroubled thoughts.
The condition of an enlightened mind
And a surrendered heart.
Communing with God in the Spirit
Taking time fore-lock
On interceding and trivailing knees
Prayers of faith go to God swiftly
It is the golden link
Of man to God's feet
"And satan trembles when he see"
The weakest saint unpon his knees
A time of charity offered with meekness
Prayer is the balm for all the ills of the soul
My native tendency an innate activity
My native air and vital breath
That gives my soul life in Christ
Giving me the absolution of sin
Keeping me in tryst with Christ
In shining sun and stormy cloud
Highest ascension comes from lowest contrite heart
A Christian battle is best done upon the knees
For zeal without prayer is wasted energy
On our knees faith and fervency spells victory
Prayer is a heart suppliant
Seeking for fresh supply of strength,
And come forth braced for duty and trial
Against many a mortal foe
Let this in mind also
In spring, a cheery tree blosoms
So is prayer to my body and soul's bosom
The act of love on the knee to the near and dear
We come to God, in adoration, penitence and petition
Thanksgivinig and intercession.</div>

        <div class="poem-text">No man is greater than his prayer life
Through it he overcomes the sins of Life
When we are not praying we are playing
Let us start praying to avoid straying
Some prefer to be players and payers
But who will join those active in prayers?
That has visions and passion
To win souls is their mission
With fellowship that is prayer conditioned
Spirituality as the condition.
Preaching affect time, prayer affect eternity
As soldiers we pray and gain victory
True prayer is spiritual promotion
Don't forget consecration by fostering competition and propaganda,
Begin Gospel propagation
For synthetic religion must go
Lets all agree and say so
The amen corner must not pass away
Zeal for street meeting will not evaporate
Our sufferings, prayers, will ameliorate.</div>

        <div class="poem-text">The throwing down of weapon of rebellion against God.
And crossing the bridge over a gorge
It does not save; none can be saved without it
From a contrite heart, it comes not by merit
It is an act preceeding believing
Christ alone does the deliverance
Not regret for sin, which comes from the devil
It is not remorse; hell is full of remorse
And all that are there know the pain utmost
It is not conviction, a convict may not repent
The conviction confession and conversion is all that is meant
It is not fear of hell many go to hell with their fears
If you don't repent, to hell you are very near
It is not simply sorrow, many sinners are in sorrow
Godly sorrow works repentance
The escape way is the way to heaven, it is narrow.
After absolution of sin for your penitence
It is from a lowly contrite heart
Confession that can put you and sin apart
Inspired by firm fire of divine love
Who is the expression of God's love
That bring about our redemption
A deep vocal confession
A heart forsaking of sin
And acknowledgement of God
A total surrender to him.</div>

Putting up as a show-strange mannerism

Enchanting with the tiara of psychology
We need Gospel spawn of sincerity
A gament from heaven in humilty.
Sermons of hermeneutics perfection
Without aunction can't give justification.
Unction on you? You are God's knighthood
The bishops hand is not the medium
From heaven it decends like dew
Illuminating your heart against evil
Making you to know, you need regeneration
Delivering you from familiar spirits
Because of the presence of the Holy Spirit
You are set free from spiritism
You are made spiritual
Beware of powerless preaching born in tomb
Instead of the womb
It is unction that brings his presence
As you are
Subdued by His omnipresence
Staggared by His omnipotence
Silenced by His ominscience
And solemnised by His holiness.</div>

Bringing Gospel to whom they meet
With light in their eyes and love in their face
And singing a hyme as they pace
The inspirirng blessed songs of heaven
And heart beating with peace, grace and love heavy
He draws sinners with chords and bands of love
From constant whirl of cares and troubles
In the ocean of iniquity
Christ saved me
Under the shade of Melancholy bough
He sought, found and saved me.
Now I am aflame with glitering rime
In proving my life with fleeting time
Lo! Christ with divine blood, bought
Me, that was under the throes of the devil
O' I will reciprocate this profound love
Whole-man, whole-heart and whole-life.
I am now careful of fame
Which many fancy
I now detastes sin
To commit it, my heart fails me
I am now modest in luxury
I can't commit any extravagance
Tamed and saved by my lord
I am now His blessed son
The former things chaffed and fretted my soul
In spite of my loathesome life
He changed my vulgar life
I won't fleet the time carelessly
I am taking time forelock to serve him
Whole time, whole man and whole heart
A new light in my life is shining
A new hope of life hereafter is dawn
A new life from now I live
No space and time can dim our love
His love bought love
Shall land me in eternity sure
Thus is my heart stayed upon God
Fret! not Lo! He keeps me company
Enjoying I the ties as of many
Though this life is full of perils
My reward above surpasses thrills
Those who hides from almighty's face
Shall be wanting of His grace</div>

        <div class="poem-text">A deep seated restlessness was produced
A life full of vague unrequited longing
An undercurrent of disappointments
Colored every minute of the day and night
Then I went to hospital of Christ Grace
For an operation on sins cancer
The perennial perpetual and, inherent disease
That saddles life with miseries
Blustering of pride, brought my heart to a fault
Satan worked to bring my life to naught
With all illness - precipitating and misery-producing
I almost had a blow of fate, that sins were inducing
But Christ cheerful assurance strenghtened my faith
And His calmed diagnosis calmed my fear
In all time and tide He was near
His operation brought me good health
Now I have outran and outputted sin
Christ spared me the nonsense and nuisance of sin-cancer
His presence is an animating span of time
Which vindicates His love rich concern
With a new lease of life
My horizons and visions broaden
I am now off the bed of sin and on a rosy bed of His love
Now I am out and around devoid of sin
My life is no longer like a flower born to blush unseen
Nor waste its sweetness on the desert air
The anticipation for heaven is now rosy
The name Jesus Christ
Is the name that gives power to His own
The potentate greater than mortal foes
Put it in mind also.</div>

A daring and unexpected conjunction
Filled with the Spirit- filled with wine
Inspiration- intoxication
Pentecost - potation
The Spirit makes one a sober temperate teetotaler
Wine make you worst than a useless drag in society
The Spirit makes you the salt and light of the world,
Wine anchors you on quick sand of morbid superiority
The Spirit increases your faith, hope and love
You need salvation to get the Spirit
Just a walk down to the bar, you have wine
With the Spirit you can say, "Oh God, I am thine"
To wine drunker satan says, "you are mine"
In the bar where you pay for wine
Your life becomes short and death is sure
Wine is the cause but the Spirit is the cure.</div>

        <div class="poem-text">I am a child of God, the God of faith
Faith is my soul's hand grapsing God's promises
My soul's eye, looking unto Jesus
There is no faith without confession.
Faith keeps life, unbelieve saps life
Faith is a corner stone of salvation
For by grace through faith is justification
Faith knows, believes and trust
Affirms, testisfies and witness to truth
Faith is my key to God's blessing
Exonerating me from cares and fretting
Faith confession create reality
Akin to hope in my human breast
Faith and works goes pari passu
And act vis-a-vis and attitude
Without it God is never pleased
Faiths fans the stimuli of God's grace
Revealing the will of God
For the will of God is knowledge
Doing the will is achievement
Faith is the key that unlocks
All the misery of the God head
Faith knows that he is a child of light
Having heritage of glorious sight
In temptation faiths stands me in good stead
And paves my way to success and victory</div>

        <div class="poem-text">The unmeritted favour
The undeserved kindness
That is Grace
Bringing the best and good
Gifts for the giver is God
The finest expression of His love
The hall mark of His concern
In her The power forgiveness and acceptance
She's the expression of God's rescue
Proceding as He was scheduled
She's priceless
Being bought by precious blood
Grace goes with Gospel
Giving to who believes in His cleansing blood
She's a gift, freely recieved, never achieved
She's not a wage, not an award, not a price
But the soul refreshing freedom to serve
God in word and world as we are saved
That is Grace.</div>

        <div class="poem-text">Sublime unmeritted favour for man from God
Bestowed to individual person
To all and sundry, not only those that Matters
The realised hope of life hereafter
That brings His eternal precedence
Making the saved a citizen of one city
The infinite and eternal heaven
And an alien in this temporary and transistory earth
The cleansing and boycotting of propensity to sin
The outward appearance of inward regenerated soul
it is the great aesthectic and artistic misery
Doubly welcomed by lost souls
It is the nature of super moral perfection
Salvation is the steping stone to God
An inherent vis-sicitude of sinnership to saintship
An operation give and take
We give out sin, we recieve salvation
The magnifying glass that concentrates God's love and grace
Salvation is spiritual blood transfusion to sinners
To give him life hereafter cast and all
Not by attainment but by atonement
Not on the ground of human merit but on divine mercy
Not by new start but by new heart
Not turning a new start but turning a new life
Not what you do but what He has done
Not developing yourself in character
But enveloping yourself in Christ
Know and do this to save yourself from mortal foes
Put it in mind, in verse or prose.</div>
